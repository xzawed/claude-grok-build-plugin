  When to delegate coding work to Grok Build vs handle it in Claude. Use whenever
  the user asks for bulk edits, test backfill, migrations, boilerplate, exploratory
  prototypes, or whether to use /grok:delegate — and when reviewing whether a task
  is safe to hand to Grok.

# Grok routing (Claude orchestrates, Grok executes)

You are in a session where the **grok** plugin can run Grok Build via MCP.
Product goal: help the user **use Grok well**, **feel Grok’s strength**, and enjoy
**Claude ↔ Grok collaboration** — not replace Claude.

## Default posture

When a task is a good fit for Grok, **propose delegation first** (brief why + tool),
then run it if the user agrees or already asked to use Grok. Do not dump every
coding task on Grok.

## Delegate to Grok when

| Fit | Examples |
|---|---|
| Bulk / repetitive | Same pattern across many files, renames, import fixes |
| Low-risk volume | Test backfill, docs sync, boilerplate CRUD/DTO/scaffold |
| Narrow independent scope | Single module, clear acceptance criteria, little monorepo coupling |
| Exploratory prototype | Try an approach fast; user will review |

**Tools (prefer this order):**

1. **Route first (no side effects):** `grok_build_route` or `/grok:route` — read **`nextAction`**
   (`handle_with_claude` | `call_mcp_tool` + tool/flags). Do not re-derive the plan.
2. If `nextAction.requiresHumanGateBeforeDelegate`: **plan** (`grok_build_plan` / `/grok:plan`)
   then wait for approval before any edit tool.
3. Execute: `grok_build_delegate` / `/grok:delegate` or verify `/grok:verify` as `nextAction.tool` says.
4. **Review gate:** `/grok:review` — diff + `billing`; never auto-commit.
5. Multi-turn: `/grok:resume` using `usage.lastSession.sessionId` or the last result’s `sessionId`.
6. Presets: `/grok:tests`, `/grok:migrate`, `/grok:boilerplate`
7. Auth / ready: `grok_build_status` (or `grok_auth_check`) or `/grok:setup`. If status
   reports **`billingMismatch`**, stop and warn that the server is in subscription mode while
   past delegations were recorded as metered — check `GROK_BUILD_AUTH_MODE` before delegating
   anything.

Always pass absolute `cwd`. Prefer English prompts for the `prompt` field.

**Do not make coding edits through `grok_cli` / `/grok:cli`.** Passthrough runs are **not**
gated by the pre-delegate auth hook and are **not** recorded in delegation history, so the
edit has no provenance. `/grok:cli` stays the escape hatch for non-editing subcommands
(`models`, `sessions`, `memory`, …); use `grok_build_delegate` / `grok_build_verify` for
anything that changes files.

Optional tool fields (validated; bad values fail without running grok): `model` (current
ids: `grok-4.6`, `grok-4.5`; `grok-build` is remapped to the CLI default), `effort`
(`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`), `resume` / `continue` (not both),
`sandbox` (`workspace` | `read-only` | `strict` | `devbox` | `off` — Linux/macOS kernel
enforce; Windows not assumed). Do **not** pass `best_of_n` — CLI 1.0 removed `--best-of-n`.
Results may include `sessionId` for later `resume`.
`filesChanged` lists paths that became dirty *during* the run; use `worktree: true` on
already-dirty trees for full attribution.

External orchestrators: copy the loop in `examples/orchestrator-consumer.md` and
`docs/07-orchestrator-integration.md`.

## Keep in Claude (do not delegate)

- Architecture / design decisions, API shape trade-offs
- Security (auth, crypto, permissions), secrets, compliance / regulated domains
- Work needing whole monorepo or very large context
- Final code review and quality gate (you always review Grok’s diff)

## After every Grok run

1. If `status` is not `completed` (`auth_error`, `timeout`, or `grok_error`), show the returned
   `message` and stop — do not report the run as done. Otherwise show `summary`,
   `filesChanged`, and especially **`billing`** (`subscription` vs `metered_api`).
2. Run the **`/grok:review`** checklist (or equivalent): adversarial correctness/security/scope.
3. **Never auto-commit**; the server never commits. User decides accept / fix / discard.
4. Risky or large work: use `worktree: true` so changes land in an isolated worktree (`worktreePath`); review there before merge.
5. Partial failure still may list `filesChanged` — inspect before continuing.
6. Offer `/grok:resume` when a `sessionId` is available for follow-ups.

## Auth failures

If tools fail with install/login messages, guide `/grok:setup` or the message’s commands.
Do not attempt `grok login` or install inside this session for the user.

## Cost note

Default mode is **subscription**. Do not thrash (no delegate-on-every-keystroke).
In API/metered mode, be stricter about fit and avoid wasteful retries.
